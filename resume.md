###Summary
I am a designer, builder, and problem solver.

I have an eye for detail and an opinion on design.

I have experience architecting entire web applications front-to-back, designing and implementing interactive user experience from wireframes to finished product, and serving as day-to-day project management.

I prefer working in fast-paced environments that foster individual ownership and value creativity.
