I'm tired of trying to keep both my resume and LinkedIn updated, as well as always struggling with formatting issues in Word. Time for a change.

I'm going to attempt hosting the master copy of my resume on this website (and default versioned on github in Markdown format). I had the idea to use LinkedIn as the master copy, and setup some sort of scraping utility that converts it to Markdown. To that end I played around with [kimono](http://www.kimonolabs.com) for a few hours today but never got it working the way I wanted to. The other downside to that approach is LinkedIn gives me no versioning.
