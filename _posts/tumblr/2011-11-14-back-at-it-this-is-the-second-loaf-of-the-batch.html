<img src="/tumblr_files/tumblr_luo92nOhSy1qgkzeyo1_1280.png"/><br/><p>Back at it. This is the second loaf of the batch and they both turned out pretty well.</p>
<p>Dough:</p>
<p>625g Water</p>
<p>15g Yeast</p>
<p>&#8212; Let sit hydrate for 15 minutes &#8212;</p>
<p>At this point I decided to make smaller batch</p>
<p>Using 300g of the mixture above, combine:</p>
<p>450g APWF</p>
<p>50g RF</p>
<p>&#8212; let sit for 15 minutes</p>
<p>add 15g Kosher Salt</p>
<p>&#8212; let sit for 15 minutes</p>
<p>knead</p>
<p>&#8212; let the dough rise for 2 hours, then refridge &#8212;</p>
<p>Bread:</p>
<p>preheat oven to 475</p>
<p>form loaf</p>
<p>&#8212; let rise for 60 minutes while oven is heating stone &#8212;</p>
<p>put loaf in oven, spray walls of oven with water</p>
<p>&#8212; 20 minues @ 475 &#8212;</p>
<p>rotate loaf</p>
<p>&#8212; 20 minutes @ 425 &#8212;</p>
<p>&#8212; turn oven off, remain in oven for 20 minutes &#8212;</p>
