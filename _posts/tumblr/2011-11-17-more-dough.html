<p>Same container as last time - I just keep it in the fridge in between batches.</p>
<p>300g water + 8g yeast and let it hydrate for 20 minutes</p>
<p>Add 425g APWF, 75g RF combine and let marinate for 20 minutes</p>
<p>Add 15g Kosher Salt, combine, knead until it approaches the window-pane test. Â I have trouble getting the dough to that level of elasticity - maybe i&#8217;m not kneading enough?</p>
<p>Let rise until it doubles, about 2 hours.</p>
<p>Into the fridge to bake tomorrow.</p>
