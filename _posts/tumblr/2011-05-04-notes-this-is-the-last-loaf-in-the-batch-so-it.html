<img src="/tumblr_files/tumblr_lkpcru7e9m1qgkzeyo1_1280.jpg"/><br/><p>Notes: This is the last loaf in the batch so it has been in the fridge for about a week. I only let it rise for 60 minutes (oven preheat only 60 minutes as well).Â  I cooked for 40 minutes rather than 35. Haven&#8217;t cut it yet but looks and smells great.</p>
<p>Next up: changing the recipe a bit.</p>
