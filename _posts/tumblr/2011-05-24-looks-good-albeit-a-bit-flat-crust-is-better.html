<ul><li>Formed the loaf and let it rise for 3 hours, upside-down in a glass bowl.</li>
<li>Baked 20 minutes @ 475 (after preheat).</li>
<li>Dropped temp to 425, rotated loaf, baked for another 20 minutes.</li>
<li>Turned oven off. Opened oven door to release some heat, let loaf in oven for 15 minutes.</li>
</ul>
