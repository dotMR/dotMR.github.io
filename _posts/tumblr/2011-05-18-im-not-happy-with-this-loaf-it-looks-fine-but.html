<img src="/tumblr_files/tumblr_llkm0kcF3g1qgkzeyo1_1280.jpg"/><br/><p>I&#8217;m not happy with this loaf. It looks fine, but it just doesn&#8217;t have the taste or texture I&#8217;m looking for.</p>
<p>I cut the yeast in this batch of dough, but this loaf came out smelling like alcohol..which I would expect from too much yeast. Also, I only got the pockets (holes) that I wanted on the outer extremities - the inside was pretty dense.</p>
