<ul><li>Std. Boule recipe from &#8216;5 minutes&#8217;</li>
<li>35 mins @ 425 degrees</li>
</ul><p><strong>Preparation Notes</strong>: I&#8217;ve been using Active Dry yeast, which I&#8217;ve read needs time to hydrate before incorporation.  So this time I let the yeast + water soak for 20 minutes and then slowly added flour and salt. I kneaded the dough by stand mixer for a couple minutes until the ingredients were dispersed and the dough turned slightly elastic, then let rise for about 2 hours. I then de-gassed the dough (punch down) several times and let rise again for another ~2 hours.  From here, the dough sat in the refrigerator for 2 days.</p>
<p>Result: Lots of rise! The holes within the bread (crumb) are more evenly distributed then earlier attempts, but the crust is a bit spongy.  I prefer a crispier crust. Maybe caused by the punch down?</p>
