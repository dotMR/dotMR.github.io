<p>This is looking better.  The crust is a little more crisp than I like, but I&#8217;m getting somewhere with the interior.  I just finished Bill Alexander&#8217;s book 52 Loaves and took some suggestions from his recipe in the back of the book.  He is baking bread at a much higher temperature than I have been.</p>
<p>What is different?</p>
<p>For this batch I formed the loaf like any other. But, I flipped the dough upside and let it rise inside of a glass oil/flour sprayed, covered bowl. After about 2.5 hours I flipped the dough onto the peel, and scored before baking.</p>
<p>The oven was preheated (and verified using a high-temp oven thermo) to 480 degrees, which is much hotter than my usual. After 20 minutes I dropped the temp to 425. After another 30 minutes I turned off the oven, and waited another 15 minutes before pulling the bread out.</p>
