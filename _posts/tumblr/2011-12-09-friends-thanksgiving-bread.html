<p>A couple of loaves for Ryan&#8217;s annual Friends&#8217; Thanksgiving</p>
<p>310g Water</p>
<p>20g Yeast</p>
<p>(hydrate for 20 minutes)</p>
<p>400g APWF</p>
<p>75g RF</p>
<p>25 WWF</p>
<p>(marinate for 20 minutes)</p>
<p>17g Salt</p>
<p>kneaded thoroughly</p>
<p>Once kneaded I let this rise in the car on the way to NYC and then left it outside on the porch overnight.</p>
<p>Ran into some complications during cooking (Tur-Duc-Ken drippage) and I was forced to take the bread out early after a flare up. The crust got a little charred on the bottom, but overall the flavor was great.</p>
<p>Baked for 20 minutes @ 500 degrees, 15 minutes @ 350, then out.</p>
