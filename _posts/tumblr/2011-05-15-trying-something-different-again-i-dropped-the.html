<p>I dropped the yeast again to 1 Tbsp rather than 1.25 in the last batch (from 1.5 originally).  I&#8217;m told that ideally you should use a little yeast as possible.  First slice seemed fine, but the jury is still out.</p>
<p>Also, no degassing after the primary fermentation.  Mixed everything, let is rise for about 2 hours, then in the fridge.</p>
<p>Yesterday I formed the loaf, let it rise for 60 minutes while the oven heated to 440, and baked for 38 minutes.</p>
