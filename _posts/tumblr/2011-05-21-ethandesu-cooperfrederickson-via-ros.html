<p>Inimitable, TC has always been one of the best dressed men I know. The influence of his time in Europe shows in his heavy worsteds, DB’s and big chunky tweeds, but it never looks contrived. He is a tall man that carries his height well, with elegance down to the ground, and never looks like he has taken too much time getting dressed, despite always being impeccable. TC is a true style hero in my world.</p>
<p>And it’s always nice to see my old blogspot photos resurfacing. Although I don’t update it, I hope it remains valid.</p>
