I enjoy working with web platforms and connected hardware.

My passion is creating product experiences that are equally useful and user-friendly.

I have ten years experience in the field of web consulting and software development. I also have four years professional experience working in a design studio producing custom furiniture, ornamental ironwork, and sculpture.

My diverse backround has influenced my perspective on design and enables me to approach problems from many different angles.
