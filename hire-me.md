I am a software engineer with a diverse background. My formal education is electrical and computer engineering with a focus on embedded systems.

Since then I have spent ten years in the field of web consulting and software development, building enterprise portals and applications.

Primarily I focus on technical design and development, but I have worked across the spectrum of project delivery including: functional road mapping, user experience design, user acceptance testing, and day-to-day project management.

I also have four years professional experience producing ornamental ironwork, custom furniture, and sculpture.

Together these experiences have influenced my perspective on design, and enable me to approach problems from many different angles.
